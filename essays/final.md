Have you ever used command prompt before? It's an app on windows. It can be used to manage files and run commands on your computer. The first time I saw command prompt I was intimidated because all you see is some text and the rest of the thing you see is mostly blank black screen. You need to type in a command to do things in command prompt. typing dir and pressing eneter, the app will show you all of the files that are in that directory. command prompt may be intimidating to some users but once you learn how to use it and familiarize yourself with it, then one day there may come a day when you enjoy using command prompt. This is what happened to me. I took a class called ICS 314 at UH Manoa. I will share with you my experience with functional progamming, coding standards, and testing. 

Functional programming in simple terms is using functions witin a function. A function is a mathematical operation done on some variable inside your code. Functions can be made for numbers or letters. I really enjoyed fucntional programming. At first it was kind of confusing but once you understand what is going on, functional programming enjoyable because you can have a very functional program with small amounts of code. I was amazed at how much things you can do with a couple lines of code. I started programming with a language called C. With C you had to code longer code to get some functionality out of it. Compared to that functional programmig in javascript was amazing. 

In my ICS 314 class I learned about coding standards. At first I did not know what that was. Coding standards are specific ways your code must look in order to standardize the code. to give an analogy, if a group of people were writing a book, they should decide on some standards for their work. This is because if many people write it, they could have different writing styles. If that team kept writing indicidually and assembled their writing into one book, the book will likely have diffent writing styles and qualities depending on where you read in the book. To avoid such thing, things will be better if they agree on the style and quality of the writing. This is very similar to how coding standards work. Some people may like the comments in the code after the code, others may want the comment of the code before the code. There are many ways and styles to code the same thing, thus it is nice to have a coding standard. When you have a coding standard, your team mate's code will be easier to read because your code will look similar to their code. If your team mate gets stuck on a task it will be much easier to help them if they confined to the coding standard. These are reasons why coding standard are important and why they should be implemented for your teams coding project.
