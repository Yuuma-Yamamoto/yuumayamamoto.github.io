This was the first time I learned JavaScript. I felt that parts of the tutorials were hard. The tutorial was challenging because you could not move on until you finished the current page. I saw some differences from the coding languages I had learned from the past. Practice WODs, in my opinion, was not as helpful as I thought it would be. 

Comparing my past experiences to JavaScript I felt that the languages are similar. Before this class, I learned C, C++, Python, and a little bit of HTML. The biggest difference I felt when learning a coding language was when I was learning HTML. I felt that JavaScript was very similar to C++. This is because they both have variables, functions, objects, and arrays. I personally like that you do not have to specify the data type when declaring variables in JavaScript. I am a very lazy person. I do not want to think really hard about things so it is nice that you can use let or const and let the language take care of different data types.  

I do not know if JavaScript is a bad programming language or a good one yet. I would have to dive deeper to grasp that. I have only just started to learn JavaScript. I would like to learn about the syntax. Usually, when I get stuck in programming, it's because I don't know the syntax. I would like as much syntax sugar as possible. I have seen assembly before, and I think that was a "bad" program because it is very hard to understand. 

I practised the WODs for more than one time. I remember getting Rx time on both of my practice WOD but I got the DNF time for my first WOD so that proves that The WODs did not help. I thought that the WOD will be a numerical calculation. It turned out that the WOD was manipulating text and not numbers. I am not fluent yet at JavaScript so I did not know how to do calculations on text. That was the cause of my failure to finish the WOD. But that is only one WOD of many. So I will continue to practice my WOD so I can finish my other WODs. 

My overall experience with JavaScript was good. Though it took a while to finish the tutorial, I felt that it was worth it because I grasped some JavaScript skills. At first, const was a little confusing for me. I thought that once an array was declared using const the contents would be a constant, so it could not change. But from further lectures, I learned that const will not change what the variable is pointing to and be able to change the contents of that variable. 

What I expect from here is to learn more JavaScript. I want to be able to manipulate text and numbers more fluently. I want to be able to come up with algorithms on the fly. Currently, it takes a lot of effort to think of algorithms. However, I believe that with practice I will be able to master these skills. I will continue to work on my programming skills to become a better computer scientist.
