My interest in software engineering is making apps, AI, and the development of future software and hardware. I would like to make several apps throughout my life. I hope to use these apps myself. I also want to learn about artificial intelligence at UH. I may cultivate my AI to be a professional at some game. I am really interested in the future of computer software and hardware. 

### My first app 

Making apps has always been on my mind for a while now. The first app I wanted was a flashcard app. I looked around in the app store for flashcard apps but I did not find any that suited my needs. Some apps were just too slow. Using the app was a hassle too. You had to learn how to use it and the gestures they had were not intuitive. 

### Artificial intelligence 

I have been hearing things about AI and how it will change our lives. Some call it the last invention humans will make. I think this is because once AI can do things better than humans at most things, people will not have to work. This is because the machine will work for us. After I learn about AI I will use that knowledge to improve my applications. For my flashcard application, AI may be used to suggest challenging cards for the user. It will try to make the cards at an optimal level of hardness, not so easy not too hard. 

### Moore's Law

Lastly, the fast-paced development in the ICS and computer hardware industries fascinates me. Processing speeds have gone up with exponential growth over the years. As the microprocessor approaches 5nm or less I really wonder what the manufacturers are going to do next. When you reach atomic sizes there is nothing that is smaller than that. Perhaps the improvement to microprocessors might halt for some time. I feel that development for software will continue in the coming years.
