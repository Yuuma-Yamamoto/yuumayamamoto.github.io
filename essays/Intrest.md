My interest in software engieering is making apps, AI, and the developmemt of future software and hardware. I would like to make several apps throughout my life. I hope to use these apps myself. I also want to learn about artificial intelligence at UH. I may cultivate my AI to be a professional at some game. I am really interested in the future of computer software and hardware. 

Making apps has always been on my mind for awile now. The first app I wanted was a flashcard app. I looked around in the app store for flashcard apps but I did not find any that suited my needs. Some apps were just too slow. Using the app was a hastle too. You had to learn how to use it and the gestures they had were not intuitive. 

I have been hearing things about AI and how it will change our lives. Some call it the last invention humans will make. I think this is because once AI can do things better than humans at most things, people will not have to work. This is because the machine will work for us.
