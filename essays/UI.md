UI frameworks is relatively easy to get started. Some of the troubles I had initally with UI frameworks were picture, alignment and grids. My experience with UI frameworks was good overall. 

I think UI framework is relatively easy to get started. What I mean by that is to use it to get some results fast. I have learned the programming language C before, and it took me more than 6 months to code something that actually did something useful. However, with UI frameworks, I was able to imitate the look of a website in a week. There are much more to learn; because currently, my websites I made with UI frameworks are not fucntional. There are no links that connect pages, and no clickable elements in my website. I hope to learn that next week. 

My initial experience with UI frameworks was rough. Initially, I did not know how to do anything. I did not know how to align the text in a way that I wanted to. Now I learned that adding a certain class will help me to align my text. If I wanted to center my menu I created, I just add the keyword "center" to my class. If I wanted to align my item to the right, then I will type "right item" instead of "item" for my class. It was that easy. I also had a very hard time getting pictures from websites. This was solved by saving the picture locally, and using that file to print to my website. The picture problem was the easiest problem to fix. Then there was the grid problem. I did not know how to make a grid for my website. I had to go to office hour to fix this problem. My professro kindly taught me to use a class called "ui two column grid". I fiddled around with the code to figure out where the text went for that class. That was when I realized that changing the two in that class to a three will change the number of columns. This was a revelation for me. I realized how "English" the UI framework was. Now I am very fond with UI frameworks for how intuitive they can be. 

My experience with UI frameworks were good overall. In the beginning things were very stressful because I did not know anything. The website I first created looked like junk. the first two days I coded, I did not think I will be able to do what I can do now. all of my text and images where tightly together, and the colors I wanted did not show up on the screen. But as I learned and practice I got better quite fast. In about 5 hours, I felt comfortable enough that I felt ready to take my weekly exam called a WOD. In the end I was not able to finish my WOD, but I was very close. The only thing I could not do was to eliminate the white spaces at the edge of my website. That was resolved by removing the ui container that I surrounded my code with. my experience with UI frameworks was enjoyable, and I am looking forward to learning more about it staring next week.
