University of hawaii at Manoa faces many issues throughout its campus. The staff work hard to maintain a clean and safe environment for the students. However the eyes of the staff cannot see everything, so they may miss some issues. This is where this app comes so that students can upload their issues when they see them. With this the university can get more infromed reports in a timely manner.
