UROV is short for Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle.  
In this project, I learned how to use the 3D printer. I used a program called Fusion 360 to create a 3D rendering of what I wanted to print. Then I converted the file into a printable file and sent the data to the 3D printer. I printed clamps for my rover. those clamps were held together by zip ties.   

We used some woodwork as well. In this project, I learned how to use the jacksaw. With the tool, I cut out some simple shapes to attach to the rover. I measured, marked and cut the wood. We also used the drill to open holes in the wood. Most of our attachments were secured with zip ties because zip ties were cheap and also easily removable. 

The challenges we faced in this project was the time constraints we had throughout the semester. Time was limited and the project class was not the only class I was taking. Also, time with our professors and assistants were limited so working around their schedule was also a little issue. We tried to overcome this issue by spending more time on the project. There were some nights when I stayed up late to finish some essay. Overall the project was a success and our team was able to gain some skill in the engineering field.
